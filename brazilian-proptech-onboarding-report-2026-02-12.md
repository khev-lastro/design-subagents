# Onboarding Pain Points & Opportunities for Real Estate Employees Using Third-Party Management Software in Brazil

## A Comprehensive Research Report

---

## Executive Summary

Brazil's real estate sector is undergoing a rapid digital transformation, yet the onboarding of employees to third-party management software remains one of the most critical and poorly addressed challenges in the industry. With approximately **580,000–730,000 registered real estate agents (corretores)**, over **70,000 real estate agencies (imobiliárias)**, and a PropTech ecosystem of **1,232+ startups**, the gap between available technology and effective adoption is vast.

This report maps the principal pain points and opportunities faced by Brazilian real estate employees when being onboarded to software platforms such as **Lais (by Lastro)**, **Maya (by Plaza)**, **Morada AI (MIA)**, **Realmate**, **Helena**, and the broader ecosystem of CRMs and AI-powered tools. The findings are synthesized from extensive web research across Brazilian and international sources, industry reports, consumer complaint platforms (Reclame Aqui), user reviews, and competitive analysis.

**Key finding:** The onboarding problem is not merely a training issue—it is a systemic challenge rooted in workforce demographics, cultural resistance, poor UX design, fragmented tool ecosystems, and a fundamental mismatch between how software is built and how real estate professionals actually work.

## 1. Market Context & Industry Landscape

### 1.1 Brazilian Real Estate Market Size

The Brazilian real estate market is massive and growing:

- **Market value:** The real estate market in Brazil is expected to reach approximately **US$8.84 trillion in 2025**, with residential real estate holding the dominant position at a projected US$7.15 trillion.
- **Growth trajectory:** The market projects approximately **10% sales growth in 2026**, driven by declining interest rates and improved macroeconomic stability.
- **Construction activity:** Lançamentos (launches) and vendas (sales) grew meaningfully in the first half of 2025, with purchase intention rising at the end of 2025 signaling a heated market for 2026.

### 1.2 Workforce Profile

Understanding who needs to be onboarded is critical:

- **Total registered agents:** Brazil closed 2024 with approximately **580,000 corretores registrados** (registered brokers) according to the COFECI-CRECI system — a 5% increase over 2023 and a 40% jump from 413,000 in 2020. By late 2025, estimates suggest the number has grown toward **730,000**.
- **Brazil is the 2nd largest market globally** for real estate agents and agencies, behind only the United States.
- **Number of agencies:** Over **70,000 imobiliárias** were active in Brazil as of March 2024, up approximately 6% year-over-year. For context, in August 2019 there were only 48,800.
- **Agent demographics:**
  - The profession is rapidly growing — Brazil gains approximately **5 new brokers per hour**
  - There is a significant generational mix: veteran brokers (often 45+) working alongside Gen-Z digital natives
  - Many agents work **autonomously** (as independent contractors) rather than being employed by a single agency
  - Education levels vary widely — the profession requires completion of a technical course in *Transações Imobiliárias* (TTI) or a degree in *Gestão Imobiliária*, but digital literacy is not a formal requirement
  - **64% of brokers** report being open to new technologies and attentive to digital launches (2021 study)

### 1.3 PropTech Ecosystem

Brazil has one of the most vibrant PropTech ecosystems in Latin America:

- **1,232 startups** mapped in the 2025 Terracotta Ventures *Mapa das Construtechs & Proptechs Brasil* — the largest portrait ever of the innovation ecosystem in this sector
- **13.5% growth** in PropTech startups in 2024 over 2023 (totaling 1,209 companies that year)
- **22,000 direct employees** in the PropTech sector
- **3 out of 6 LatAm PropTech unicorns** are Brazilian: Creditas, Loft, and QuintoAndar
- **Over 2,000 proptechs** estimated active by 2025 when including smaller or unmapped companies
- The ecosystem is organized into four main categories: Project & Feasibility, Construction, Acquisition, and Property in Use

**Investment landscape:**
- PropTech investment in Brazil accumulated **hundreds of millions of dollars** between 2021–2024
- Key recent rounds include Lastro's **US$15M Series A** led by Prosus Ventures (October 2025)
- The Latin America PropTech market generated **USD 1.4 billion** in revenue in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 13.6% toward 2030

### 1.4 Technology Adoption Maturity

The current state of digitalization reveals a market in transition:

- **Over 60%** of real estate companies globally have integrated CRM software; Brazil's adoption is lower but accelerating
- Tools like 360° virtual tours, chatbots, electronic signatures, and modern CRMs are becoming part of daily routines for companies seeking differentiation
- **WhatsApp is the dominant communication channel** — virtually every real estate transaction in Brazil involves WhatsApp at some point, making it the de facto CRM for many agents
- Digital contracts and electronic signatures can accelerate deal closing by up to **70%**
- The proptech ecosystem now includes over 1,200 companies applying big data, geolocation, virtual reality, and blockchain to transactions

### 1.5 Regulatory Environment

Key regulatory factors affecting software adoption:

- **LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados):** Brazil's data protection law has significant implications for real estate software, as the sector deals intensively with personal data (client information, financial data, property records). Compliance adds complexity to software adoption and onboarding.
- **CRECI regulation:** All brokers must be registered with their regional CRECI council, creating a regulated profession. The **Resolução Cofeci n.º 1.486/2024** marks the first structured institutional movement focused on regulating technology in the sector.
- **Absence of robust PropTech-specific legislation:** The regulatory framework has not kept pace with technological innovation, creating uncertainty around areas like tokenization and AI-driven automation.
- **SGR platform:** A digital platform connecting cartórios (registries), notaries, lawyers, and brokers is being developed to optimize real estate transactions.

## 2. Platform Analysis: Key Software Tools

### 2.1 Lais by Lastro

**What it is:** The most well-funded AI assistant for real estate in Brazil. Lais is an autonomous AI agent designed for real estate agencies, operating primarily through WhatsApp.

**Key details:**
- **Funding:** US$15.7M Series A led by Prosus Ventures (October 2025), total raised approximately US$16M
- **Scale:** Has empowered over **2 million homebuyers** through AI-assisted interactions
- **Core function:** Automated lead engagement and qualification via WhatsApp; has evolved to handle broader agency workflows
- **Target users:** Imobiliárias (real estate agencies) of all sizes
- **Positioning:** "The most advanced AI in the real estate sector"
- **Key value prop:** Agencies using AI in pre-service experience **up to 60% higher conversion rates**
- **Reclame Aqui status:** Only 2 complaints on record, 100% response rate, average response time of 1 day and 2 hours. Insufficient complaint volume to calculate reputation score.
- **Website:** lais.ai

**Onboarding relevance:** As an AI-first product operating through WhatsApp (a familiar channel), Lais may have a lower friction onboarding path than traditional CRMs — but this also means employees must learn to trust and manage an AI system rather than learning a software interface directly.

### 2.2 Maya by Plaza

**What it is:** A generative AI virtual assistant built specifically for real estate agencies, developed by Plaza with a R$2 million investment.

**Key details:**
- **Investment:** R$2 million in development
- **Core function:** Speeds up first contact with leads, indicating properties and pre-scheduling visits **in up to 15 seconds**
- **Product line:** Includes **Maya ADM** — a version specifically for rental administration/property management workflow automation
- **Positioning:** "The most complete AI in the real estate market"
- **Target users:** Imobiliárias and individual corretores
- **Reclame Aqui:** Maya as a company received 3 complaints, responded to **0%** of them, with 3 complaints still awaiting response — a potential red flag for support quality
- **Website:** useplaza.com.br

**Onboarding relevance:** Maya's dual focus on both sales (lead qualification) and administration (Maya ADM for rentals) means employees may need onboarding for two different operational contexts. The 0% Reclame Aqui response rate suggests potential post-sale support challenges.

### 2.3 Morada AI (MIA)

**What it is:** A PropTech pioneer in LATAM focused on AI for real estate developers (incorporadoras), with its AI assistant called MIA.

**Key details:**
- **Founded:** 2021
- **Funding:** R$6 million in investment, planning to reach 700 incorporadoras
- **Scale:** MIA's AI **accounts for 21% of the country's real estate launches** — a remarkable market penetration
- **Core function:** AI conversational assistant for property purchase, including MIA Voice (voice-based AI on WhatsApp)
- **Target users:** Primarily **incorporadoras** (developers), not individual agencies
- **Key features:** Real-time visualization of attendances, scheduling, and transfers; land prospecting technology; CRM management for developers
- **Partnerships:** Works with major developers like Cyrela and Direcional
- **Innovation:** Launched at Web Summit Lisboa with conversational AI for property purchases
- **Website:** morada.ai

**Onboarding relevance:** Morada AI targets a different persona (developer employees vs. agency brokers). Its onboarding challenge is getting construction/development company staff — who may be even less tech-savvy than brokers — to work with an AI system that directly impacts sales and launches.

### 2.4 Realmate

**What it is:** An omnichannel customer service platform specifically built for real estate agencies, centralizing WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook communications.

**Key details:**
- **Core function:** Centralizes all conversation channels (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook) in one platform; features **Rafa**, an AI assistant for automatic pre-service
- **AI assistant (Rafa):** Handles automatic lead pre-service across digital channels (WhatsApp, website, social media), responding in seconds and qualifying interest
- **Key differentiator:** "Mystery client" (cliente oculto) service that evaluates agencies' digital customer service quality
- **Integrations:** Direct integrations with real estate portals (Grupo Zap, Imovelweb, Chaves na Mão), Meta Ads, and various others
- **Meta partnership:** Official Meta partner for real estate-focused WhatsApp Business API solutions
- **B2B Stack rating:** 5.0/5.0 across functionality, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and customer support
- **Mobile:** Available on both iOS App Store and Google Play
- **Website:** realmate.com.br

**Onboarding relevance:** Realmate's focus on centralizing existing channels (WhatsApp, Instagram) that agents already use daily could make onboarding smoother. The platform builds on existing behaviors rather than replacing them entirely. The 5.0 B2B Stack rating suggests good user satisfaction.

### 2.5 Helena

**Research findings:** Despite extensive searching across multiple queries in both Portuguese and English, **no specific PropTech product named "Helena" was found** in the Brazilian real estate AI/software market. The search returned:
- Helena Imóveis (a real estate agency in Rio Grande do Sul)
- Various professionals named Helena in real estate
- No AI assistant or software platform called Helena

**Possible explanations:**
- Helena may be a very new or stealth-mode product not yet publicly documented
- It could be an internal/white-label tool used by a specific agency or developer
- It may be a regional tool with limited online presence
- The name may refer to a different product or have been confused with another tool

**Note:** If "Helena" refers to a specific tool the requester has in mind, additional context would help identify it precisely.

### 2.6 Other Major Players in the Ecosystem

The broader competitive landscape includes well-established platforms:

| Platform | Type | Key Feature |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Vista Software (Vista CRM)** | Full CRM for agencies | Implantation expertise for medium/large agencies |
| **Jetimob** | CRM + Website | 6 best real estate systems in Brazil |
| **Kenlo** (formerly InGaia) | Ecosystem platform | 10,000+ connected agencies |
| **Universal Software** | CRM + ERP + Site | Scalable plans, WhatsApp integration |
| **Superlógica** | ERP for property management | Rental administration focus |
| **CV CRM** | Sales CRM | Lead automation, real estate focused |

| **Arbo Imóveis** | CRM + Portal | Lead management |
| **QuintoAndar** | Rental/Sales platform | Consumer-facing, largest LatAm proptech |
| **Loft** | iBuyer / Platform | Technology-heavy real estate transactions |

## 3. Pain Point #1: Digital Literacy & Workforce Demographics

### The Problem

The Brazilian real estate workforce spans a wide spectrum of digital literacy, creating a fundamental challenge for software onboarding.

### Key Findings

**Generational divide is real and impactful:**
- The profession ranges from 20-something digital natives to 60+ year-old veterans
- A significant portion of agents entered the profession before the digital era and learned through personal relationships and physical interactions
- **64% of agents say they are open to technology** — but this means **36% are not**, and even among the 64%, openness doesn't equal proficiency
- The new generation of brokers is "transforming the market" with a digital-first mindset, but they represent a minority

**Brazil's general digital literacy context:**
- More than **93.6% of Brazil's population** has internet access, but digital literacy for professional tools varies dramatically
- Brazil is training 5 million learners to work with AI by 2027 (Microsoft initiative), indicating a recognized national gap
- The country's digital skills gap is being addressed through initiatives at the national level, but real estate-specific training is sparse

**Education system disconnect:**
- The CRECI certification process (TTI course or Gestão Imobiliária degree) **does not include mandatory technology/software training**
- Formation takes 8-12 months, focused on legal aspects, property valuation, and sales techniques — not CRM usage or digital tools
- Only a handful of professional development courses include digital positioning or technology usage

**What this means for onboarding:**
- **One-size-fits-all onboarding fails** because the same platform must serve a 22-year-old who lives on their phone and a 55-year-old who primarily uses WhatsApp for personal communication
- Training programs must accommodate radically different baseline competencies
- Many agents have never used a CRM, ERP, or any structured software tool — their "system" has been WhatsApp + Excel spreadsheets (if that)
- The concept of structured data entry, pipeline management, and digital workflows may be entirely foreign

### Impact on Onboarding

| Factor | Impact | Severity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| No baseline software training in certification | Agents arrive with zero CRM experience | Critical |
| Age diversity (20s to 60s) | Training must adapt to multiple learning styles | High |
| WhatsApp as sole digital tool for many | Everything else feels foreign | High |
| Autonomous work culture | No manager to enforce tool adoption | High |
| High agent turnover | Continuous onboarding demand | Medium |

## 4. Pain Point #2: Cultural & Organizational Resistance

### The Problem

The Brazilian real estate industry has a deeply entrenched culture of relationship-based selling, personal networks, and resistance to process formalization. This creates systemic resistance to technology adoption.

### Key Findings

**Conservative mindset persists:**
- One of the main obstacles identified across multiple sources is the **"mindset arcaico e conservador"** (archaic and conservative mindset) still present in the real estate sector
- Many experienced agents believe their personal network and relationship skills are what close deals — not software
- The attitude of "I've been doing it this way for 20 years and it works" is pervasive

**Fear of replacement:**
- AI-powered tools (Lais, Maya, MIA, Rafa) trigger existential concerns: **"Will this AI take my job?"**
- Agents who depend on commissions fear that automation will commoditize their role
- The concept of AI handling the first client contact — traditionally seen as the broker's value-add — is threatening

**Organizational dynamics:**
- Many agencies are small (3-10 agents), run by an owner who may themselves resist technology
- When the agency owner is not a technology champion, adoption stalls at the organizational level
- In larger agencies, mid-level managers may resist tools that increase transparency (e.g., CRMs that track response times and lead conversion)

**The transparency problem:**
- CRM tools reveal **how fast agents respond to leads, how many leads they convert, and where they spend their time**
- Some agents deliberately avoid logging data because it creates accountability
- Management visibility into agent performance can be perceived as surveillance rather than support

**Commission and incentive misalignment:**
- Agents are typically paid on commission, not salary
- Time spent learning a new system is time **not spent closing deals**
- There is rarely an immediate financial incentive for adopting new tools — the ROI is medium-to-long-term

**CRM failure rates as a reference:**
- Research globally shows CRM failure rates range between **18% and 69%**, with most estimates in the **20-70% range**
- The primary cause is not technical failure but **user adoption failure**
- These global statistics are likely worse in Brazil given the additional cultural and literacy barriers

### Resistance Patterns Observed

1. **Passive resistance:** Agents create accounts but never log in after the first week
2. **Workaround resistance:** Agents continue using WhatsApp privately while "officially" using the CRM
3. **Data sabotage:** Agents enter minimal or incorrect data to fulfill requirements without actual adoption
4. **Vocal opposition:** Senior agents publicly criticize new tools, influencing younger team members
5. **Management bypass:** Agency owners implement tools but don't use them themselves, sending a contradictory message

---

## 5. Pain Point #3: UX/UI Design Failures

### The Problem

Real estate management software often suffers from poor user experience design, creating unnecessary friction during onboarding and ongoing use.

### Key Findings

**Feature overload is the #1 UX problem:**
- Real estate CRMs often choose to be "feature-complete" at the expense of usability
- The urge to include AI-driven analytics, predictive modeling, complex reporting, and dozens of configurable options creates interfaces that overwhelm new users
- If users don't use most features, they are "essentially overpaying for a tool that adds complexity without delivering value"
- Many platforms attempt to serve agencies of 3 agents and agencies of 300 with the same interface

**Cluttered interfaces slow adoption:**
- "Overwhelmed buyers, disorganized internal tools, and clunky dashboards slow real estate products down"
- Features are present but users **"don't notice them or use them in the wrong context"**
- Navigation structures that make sense to developers rarely align with how brokers think about their work

**Legacy system UX patterns persist:**
- Older systems force everyone into the same layout regardless of role
- Modern tools sometimes inherit UX patterns from legacy systems rather than rethinking the experience
- The "spreadsheet as interface" pattern (rows of data with tiny buttons) is common but hostile to non-technical users

**Real estate-specific UX mistakes identified:**

1. **No role-based views:** The same dashboard for an agency owner, a senior broker, a junior agent, and an admin assistant
2. **Data entry-heavy workflows:** Requiring manual input of information that could be automated or inferred
3. **Poor search/filter for properties:** Agents need to quickly find properties matching client criteria; many CRMs make this harder than it should be
4. **No progressive disclosure:** All features visible from day one instead of revealing complexity gradually
5. **Inconsistent mobile experience:** Desktop-first design that barely works on mobile (see Pain Point #9)

**Reclame Aqui complaint patterns for real estate software:**
- **Arbo Imóveis:** Complaints about being the "worst technology and CRM company"
- **Vista CRM:** Listed complaints on Reclame Aqui indicating user frustrations
- **Kenlo (InGaia):** Multiple complaints about the platform
- Recurring themes: difficulty of use, data loss, poor support, billing issues

**What good looks like (but is rarely implemented):**
- Decluttering the screen and grouping related objects
- Using visual aids to highlight key elements
- Hiding secondary features by default with toggleable advanced modes
- **Minimalist mode** with only essential tools to reduce cognitive overload
- Role-based progressive onboarding that reveals features as users master basics

### UX Debt Impact on Onboarding

| UX Issue | Onboarding Impact |
|----------|-------------------|
| Feature overload | Users feel overwhelmed on day 1 and never return |
| No progressive disclosure | Everything is equally prominent, nothing feels intuitive |
| Desktop-first design | Field agents can't use the tool where they work |
| Complex data entry | Users avoid the system to avoid the work of inputting data |
| No role-based customization | Irrelevant features clutter every user's experience |

---

## 6. Pain Point #4: Data Migration & Integration Chaos

### The Problem

Moving from existing systems (spreadsheets, WhatsApp, legacy software, or even paper) to a new platform is one of the highest-friction moments in onboarding.

### Key Findings

**The spreadsheet-to-software transition:**
- A significant portion of Brazilian agencies still manage operations via **Excel spreadsheets, Google Sheets, or physical notebooks**
- Migrating from spreadsheets to structured CRM involves not just data transfer but **process redesign**
- Data in spreadsheets is often inconsistent, incomplete, duplicated, or incorrectly formatted
- The question "Sua imobiliária ainda usa planilhas?" (Does your agency still use spreadsheets?) is the title of major industry articles — indicating this is still a common reality

**CRM-to-CRM migration pain:**
- The concept of "portabilidade no setor imobiliário" (portability in the real estate sector) is being discussed but is far from solved
- Migrating from one CRM to another risks **data loss, broken integrations, and period of reduced productivity**
- There is no standardized data format across real estate CRMs in Brazil
- **60% of leads are lost due to lack of organization and proper follow-up** — this number spikes during system transitions

**Integration complexity:**
- Agencies typically use **multiple disconnected tools**: one for leads, one for property listings, one for contracts, one for communication
- Key integration points include: real estate portals (Grupo Zap, Imovelweb, OLX), messaging (WhatsApp Business API), social media (Instagram, Facebook), payment systems, and government registries
- The article "Integrações de softwares imobiliários: o que levar em conta ao contratar?" highlights that integration is a critical decision factor but often poorly executed
- Each integration point is a potential failure during onboarding

**Data quality problems:**
- Historical client data may include outdated phone numbers, incorrect property details, and duplicate entries
- Cleaning data before migration is essential but rarely done — agencies want to "just move everything over"
- Once dirty data enters a new system, it erodes trust in the platform ("This system has wrong information, it's useless")

### Migration Risk Matrix

| Migration Path | Difficulty | Data Loss Risk | Productivity Impact |
|---------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Paper/Phone → CRM | Very High | Very High (data may not exist digitally) | Severe for 1-3 months |
| Spreadsheets → CRM | High | Medium (formatting issues) | Significant for 2-4 weeks |
| CRM A → CRM B | Medium-High | Medium (format incompatibility) | Moderate for 1-2 weeks |
| Adding AI layer to existing CRM | Low-Medium | Low | Low if integration works |

---

## 7. Pain Point #5: Workflow Disruption & Productivity Loss

### The Problem

Adopting new software fundamentally changes how people work, creating a temporary (and sometimes permanent) productivity dip that threatens adoption.

### Key Findings

**The "productivity valley of death":**
- When adopting a new system, agencies experience an initial period where productivity **drops** before it (theoretically) improves
- For commission-based agents, this productivity dip directly impacts their income
- If the valley lasts too long or is too deep, agents abandon the new tool and revert to old methods

**Workflow redesign is not just tool replacement:**
- Software adoption is often treated as "use this tool instead of that one" when it actually requires **rethinking the entire workflow**
- Agencies that just "install and expect" without redesigning processes see the worst adoption rates
- The gap between the promised workflow and the actual workflow creates frustration

**Speed concerns:**
- Agents have internalized fast, informal workflows: receive lead via WhatsApp → call immediately → show property → close deal
- Structured CRM workflows add steps: log into system → enter lead data → assign to pipeline → schedule follow-up → update status → etc.
- Each additional step feels like friction when agents are racing competitors to respond first
- Lais and Maya's value proposition of responding in **under 15 seconds** directly addresses this concern

**Fear of losing leads during transition:**
- Studies show **60% of real estate leads are lost** due to lack of organization and follow-up
- During system transitions, the risk of losing leads is even higher
- Agents worry that leads arriving during the changeover period will fall through the cracks
- This fear is both legitimate (transitions do cause missed leads) and amplified by resistance

**Parallel system running:**
- Many agencies end up running old and new systems simultaneously during transition
- This doubles the workload instead of reducing it
- Agents resent being asked to enter the same data twice
- Eventually, the "new system" becomes the one that gets neglected

### Productivity Impact Timeline

```
Week 1-2:  ████████░░ Excitement + Training (Productivity -30%)
Week 3-4:  ██████░░░░ Reality sets in (Productivity -50%)
Week 5-8:  ███████░░░ Gradual recovery (Productivity -20%)
Week 9-12: █████████░ Approaching baseline (Productivity -10%)
Week 13+:  ██████████ Target: exceeds old productivity (+10-30%)
```

**The critical danger zone is weeks 3-4**, when initial enthusiasm fades and the full complexity of the new system becomes apparent. This is when most abandonment occurs.

## 8. Pain Point #6: AI-Specific Onboarding Challenges

### The Problem

AI-powered tools (Lais, Maya, MIA, Rafa) introduce a fundamentally different onboarding challenge: teaching people to work **with** an autonomous AI rather than **using** a traditional software tool.

### Key Findings

**Trust deficit:**
- Agents are asked to hand over their most valuable asset — the first client contact — to an AI
- "What if the AI says something wrong and I lose the client?"
- "What if the AI recommends the wrong property?"
- Trust must be built through demonstrated results, but agents resist giving the AI enough opportunities to prove itself

**Understanding AI capabilities vs. limitations:**
- Users often have one of two extreme mental models:
  1. **AI as magic:** Expecting the AI to do everything perfectly with no guidance
  2. **AI as useless:** Dismissing the AI's capabilities entirely based on one bad interaction
- Neither extreme supports healthy adoption
- Onboarding must calibrate expectations to reality

**The "handoff" problem:**
- AI tools like Lais, Maya, and MIA handle initial lead qualification, then hand off to human agents
- This handoff point is critical and often problematic:
  - When should the AI transfer to a human?
  - How much context does the human receive?
  - Does the human feel prepared or blindsided?
  - Is the conversation continuity maintained?

**AI training and customization:**
- These AI tools need to be "trained" on an agency's specific inventory, pricing, policies, and brand voice
- Who is responsible for this training? It's usually dumped on the same agents who are already resistant
- The quality of AI output directly depends on the quality of data input (garbage in, garbage out)

**Voice AI adds complexity:**
- Morada AI's **MIA Voice** (voice-based AI on WhatsApp) adds another layer:
  - Voice interactions feel more personal and risky (bad voice AI is worse than bad text AI)
  - Users must learn new interaction patterns
  - Voice AI on WhatsApp is still novel enough to confuse even tech-savvy users

**Metric transparency:**
- AI tools promise measurable improvements (60% higher conversion, responses in 15 seconds)
- But if agencies don't have baseline metrics, they can't verify improvement
- If the AI underperforms expectations (which are often inflated by marketing), trust collapses quickly

### AI Onboarding vs. Traditional Software Onboarding

| Dimension | Traditional CRM | AI-Powered Tool |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| What user learns | Interface navigation, data entry | How to supervise/collaborate with AI |
| Trust model | User controls everything | User delegates to AI |
| Failure mode | User error | AI error (feels worse) |
| Customization | Settings and preferences | Training data and rules |
| Ongoing learning | Feature updates | AI behavior evolution |
| Success metric | User activity in system | Business outcome (conversions) |

---

## 9. Pain Point #7: Cost, ROI & Business Model Friction

### The Problem

For a market dominated by small agencies and commission-based agents, the cost of software adoption and the difficulty of measuring ROI create significant onboarding barriers.

### Key Findings

**Pricing landscape:**
- Software plans in Brazil range from approximately **R$99/month** (basic CRM without site) to **R$599/month** (complete agency solution with advanced reports)
- For a small agency with 3-5 agents, even R$99-200/month can feel significant, especially when benefits aren't immediately visible
- AI-powered tools (Lais, Maya, MIA) may have higher price points due to the technology involved
- Universal Software and others offer scalable plans, but agencies often start with the cheapest and get limited functionality

**ROI measurement challenge:**
- The ROI of CRM/PropTech investment "pays off quickly through reduced lost leads and increased operational efficiency" — but measuring this requires:
  1. Baseline data (which most agencies don't have)
  2. Consistent usage (which takes months to establish)
  3. Attribution capability (which most tools don't clearly provide)
- Agencies want to see ROI in weeks; meaningful ROI takes months
- The average agency investment is expected to pay for itself, but the timeline is uncertain

**Hidden costs of implementation:**
- Software subscription is just one cost
- Additional costs include:
  - Time spent in training (opportunity cost for commission-based agents)
  - Data migration and cleanup
  - Integration setup with existing tools
  - Ongoing customization and configuration
  - Potential need for hardware upgrades (newer phones, faster internet)
  - WhatsApp Business API costs (for tools that use it)

**The small agency dilemma:**
- Brazilian real estate agencies are predominantly small businesses
- A 3-person agency with R$3,000/month in overhead can't easily absorb R$500/month for software + training time
- These agencies often need the most help with organization and technology but can least afford it
- Free or freemium options exist (some platforms offer free CRM for individual agents) but are limited in functionality

**Pricing perception:**
- Many agents compare software costs to their commission on a single deal rather than to monthly overhead
- "Why pay R$300/month when I could use that to buy ads?" is a common objection
- The value of systematic lead management vs. ad-hoc deal-closing is hard to quantify for someone who has always worked informally

---

## 10. Pain Point #8: Regulatory & Compliance Complexity

### The Problem

Brazil's regulatory environment adds layers of complexity to software adoption that both vendors and agencies must navigate.

### Key Findings

**LGPD compliance is critical but poorly understood:**
- The LGPD requires real estate companies to:
  - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing
  - Provide data access and deletion rights to clients
  - Implement security measures for data protection
  - Have a designated data protection officer
- Many agencies don't fully understand their obligations
- Software platforms must be LGPD-compliant, but this compliance creates additional setup steps during onboarding (consent forms, data policies, retention settings)
- CRECISP has dedicated LGPD guidance pages, indicating it's a recognized challenge

**CRECI professional requirements:**
- Software used for client communication may need to comply with CRECI advertising and conduct rules
- AI tools that communicate directly with clients raise questions about professional responsibility: if the AI gives incorrect information, who is liable — the agent, the agency, or the software vendor?
- These questions are largely unresolved

**Emerging regulations:**
- **Resolução Cofeci n.º 1.486/2024:** First institutional regulation specifically addressing technology in real estate
- **PL 4.438/2025:** Senate bill seeking to create a definitive legal framework for property tokenization
- The regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly, meaning software onboarding may need to accommodate changing compliance requirements

**Impact on onboarding:**
- Compliance setup adds friction to the initial configuration process
- Agents must understand data protection obligations when using new tools
- Some agents may resist tools that "collect too much data" out of LGPD anxiety
- Software vendors who simplify compliance (built-in LGPD features) have an advantage

---

## 11. Pain Point #9: Mobile-First Reality vs Desktop-First Design

### The Problem

Brazilian real estate agents are among the most mobile workforces in any industry — yet much of the software available to them was designed primarily for desktop use.

### Key Findings

**The mobile reality:**
- Real estate agents spend the majority of their working hours **outside the office**: showing properties, meeting clients, attending launches, networking
- **WhatsApp** is the primary work tool, used exclusively on mobile by most agents
- Brazil has one of the highest smartphone penetration rates in Latin America
- Many agents don't have a desktop computer or laptop at all — their phone IS their office

**Design reality vs. user reality:**
- Many CRMs and management platforms were built desktop-first with a mobile version added as an afterthought
- "Responsive design" that simply shrinks a desktop interface into a phone screen is functionally unusable
- Complex data entry forms designed for keyboard and mouse are hostile on a 6-inch touchscreen
- Dashboard visualizations that work on a 27" monitor become illegible on a phone

**App availability and quality:**
- Some platforms offer native mobile apps (Realmate is available on both iOS and Android)
- Others offer only web-responsive access, which is slower and less reliable
- App Store and Google Play reviews often highlight functionality gaps between mobile and desktop versions
- Push notification management is critical for mobile users but often poorly implemented

**WhatsApp-native advantage:**
- Tools that operate **through WhatsApp** (like Lais and Maya) have a fundamental mobile advantage
- Agents don't need to learn a new interface — they work within a tool they already use daily
- However, WhatsApp-based tools have limitations in data visualization, reporting, and complex workflows

**Connectivity considerations:**
- Agents visiting properties may have unreliable internet connections
- Software that requires constant connectivity fails in these scenarios
- Offline capability is important but rarely available
- Brazil's mobile data quality varies significantly by region

---

## 12. Pain Point #10: Support, Documentation & Ongoing Training

### The Problem

Onboarding is not a one-time event but an ongoing process, and the quality of post-implementation support determines long-term adoption success.

### Key Findings

**SaaS onboarding failure rates:**
- SaaS companies can lose **75% of new users within the first week** without effective onboarding
- The first 7 days are critical for habit formation
- Users who don't experience an "aha moment" within the first session rarely return

**Documentation quality varies dramatically:**
- Some platforms invest heavily in knowledge bases, video tutorials, and onboarding workflows
- Others rely on "call our support team" as the primary learning resource
- Portuguese-language documentation is sometimes a translation of English materials, losing context and nuance
- Video content (YouTube tutorials, webinars) is increasingly important for this audience

**Support models:**
- **Realmate:** B2B Stack rating of 5.0/5.0 for customer support — suggesting a strong support model
- **Lastro (Lais):** 100% response rate on Reclame Aqui but very few complaints to evaluate
- **Plaza (Maya):** 0% response rate on Reclame Aqui — a significant warning sign
- **Vista Software:** Has dedicated case studies for implantation in medium/large agencies
- **Kenlo:** Listed complaints on Reclame Aqui suggest support challenges

**The training gap after initial onboarding:**
- Initial training is provided (if at all) during setup
- But software evolves: new features are added, AI behavior changes, integrations update
- Ongoing training is rarely structured
- Agent turnover means new people join and need to be onboarded with no formal process
- The "tribal knowledge" problem: only one or two people in an agency really know how to use the tool, and when they leave, knowledge is lost

**Community and peer learning:**
- Very few platforms have user communities or peer-learning mechanisms
- WhatsApp groups among users emerge organically but are not supported by vendors
- Best practices are not systematically shared
- Industry events (like Conecta Imobi) provide learning opportunities but are infrequent

**SaaS onboarding best practices rarely implemented:**
1. **Focus on benefits over features** — show users how the product helps their specific situation
2. **Progressive onboarding** — reveal complexity gradually, not all at once
3. **In-app guidance** — contextual tips and walkthroughs within the interface
4. **Quick wins** — ensure users experience value within the first session
5. **Checklists and milestones** — give users a sense of progress
6. **Personalized pathways** — different onboarding for different roles (owner, agent, admin)

## 14. Opportunities & Strategic Recommendations

### Opportunity #1: WhatsApp-Native Onboarding

**The insight:** WhatsApp is the one tool that virtually every Brazilian real estate professional already uses daily and is comfortable with.

**Recommendation:**
- Build onboarding flows that happen **inside WhatsApp** rather than requiring users to visit a separate platform
- Use WhatsApp chatbots to guide initial setup, answer questions, and provide tips
- Send daily micro-learning messages via WhatsApp during the first 30 days
- Allow the first meaningful interactions with the software to happen through WhatsApp before introducing the full dashboard

### Opportunity #2: Role-Based Progressive Onboarding

**The insight:** A junior agent, a senior broker, an agency owner, and an administrative assistant all need different features at different times.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement role-based onboarding paths that show only relevant features for each persona
- Use progressive disclosure: start with 3-5 essential features, then unlock more as users demonstrate proficiency
- Create a "minimalist mode" for resistant users that covers only the absolute essentials
- Allow power users to access advanced features without forcing complexity on everyone

### Opportunity #3: "Quick Win" Architecture

**The insight:** If users don't experience value within the first session, they likely never will.

**Recommendation:**
- Design the first interaction to deliver a measurable result:
  - Import contacts and immediately show them organized in a visual pipeline
  - Have AI respond to a real lead and show the conversation quality
  - Generate a professional property listing in under 2 minutes
  - Show how much time a specific task would save with automation
- Reduce time-to-value from days to minutes

### Opportunity #4: Intermediary Tools for CRM Adoption

**The insight:** The gap between "no system" and "full CRM" is too large. An intermediate step is needed.

**Recommendation:**
- Build lightweight tools that agents adopt **before** the full CRM:
  - A simple WhatsApp lead tracker that just logs conversations
  - A property matching tool that suggests listings based on client preferences
  - A follow-up reminder system (SMS/WhatsApp) that requires zero interface learning
- These tools create data and habits that make full CRM adoption natural

### Opportunity #5: Data Migration as a Service

**The insight:** Data migration is one of the most painful and technically complex aspects of onboarding that agencies are unable to handle themselves.

**Recommendation:**
- Offer **white-glove data migration** as a standard part of onboarding, not an add-on
- Build tools that can import from Excel, Google Sheets, and competing CRMs automatically
- Include data cleanup as part of the migration process
- Provide a "data quality report" that shows agencies what their data looks like after migration
- Consider offering to run parallel systems for 30 days with automatic data sync

### Opportunity #6: AI Trust-Building Programs

**The insight:** AI-powered tools require a fundamentally different trust-building process than traditional software.

**Recommendation:**
- Start AI tools in **"shadow mode"**: the AI generates responses but a human reviews them before sending
- Show agents a dashboard of AI performance: "AI qualified 47 leads today, 12 scheduled visits, 3 were wrong"
- Allow agents to customize AI behavior: "Don't recommend properties above R$800K without asking"
- Create "AI vs. Agent" comparisons that show how the AI performs on identical leads
- Use the "cliente oculto" (mystery client) approach that Realmate pioneered to demonstrate baseline quality

### Opportunity #7: Community-Driven Adoption

**The insight:** Agents trust other agents more than they trust software vendors.

**Recommendation:**
- Build user communities where successful agencies share their onboarding experiences
- Create "champion" programs where tech-savvy agents in each agency become internal advocates
- Facilitate peer-to-peer learning through structured WhatsApp groups, webinars, and local meetups
- Publish case studies with real names, real numbers, and real agency stories

### Opportunity #8: Mobile-First (Actually Mobile-Only) Design

**The insight:** For many agents, their phone is their only work device.

**Recommendation:**
- Design the primary experience for mobile, then adapt to desktop — not the reverse
- Ensure all critical workflows can be completed on a phone in under 3 taps
- Implement offline capability for property visits in areas with poor connectivity
- Use phone-native features: camera for photos, GPS for location, contacts for lead import
- Consider voice-first interactions for agents who are driving or at a property showing

### Opportunity #9: Gamification and Incentive Alignment

**The insight:** Commission-based agents respond to incentives, not mandates.

**Recommendation:**
- Gamify onboarding with visible progress metrics ("You've completed 70% of setup!")
- Show direct financial impact: "Agents using [feature X] close 23% more deals"
- Create leaderboards for adoption metrics (with permission) that make tool mastery a competitive advantage
- Partner with agencies to tie software adoption to bonus structures
- Offer tangible rewards for completing onboarding milestones

### Opportunity #10: Addressing the Small Agency Gap

**The insight:** With 70,000+ agencies and most being small businesses, there's a massive underserved market.

**Recommendation:**
- Create genuinely free tiers that deliver real value (not just trials)
- Build "agency-in-a-box" solutions that provide CRM + Website + WhatsApp integration at R$99/month or less
- Reduce implementation time to **under 1 hour** through automated setup
- Offer pay-per-result models instead of subscriptions (charge per qualified lead rather than monthly fee)
- Target the 36% of agents who don't consider themselves tech-open with extremely simple, benefit-focused messaging

## 15. International Benchmarks & Lessons

### United States: Mature but Fragmented

- The US real estate market has a mature PropTech ecosystem with platforms like Zillow, Realtor.com, Follow Up Boss, and kvCORE
- **NAR data shows 62% CRM adoption** among agencies — Brazil is below this but catching up
- US lesson: **Integration standards** (like RETS/RESO for MLS data) dramatically reduce onboarding friction
- Brazil lacks equivalent data standards, making each integration a custom effort

### Global PropTech Market Context

- Global PropTech market valued at approximately **USD 35.9 billion in 2024**, projected to reach **USD 124.6 billion by 2035** (CAGR 11.98%)
- AI is the most transformative technology for the sector in 2025-2026
- Best-in-class onboarding globally focuses on:
  1. **Value-first demonstrations** (showing ROI before requiring commitment)
  2. **Embedded workflows** (working within existing tools like email and messaging)
  3. **Continuous education** (not just initial training)
  4. **Data-driven personalization** (adapting the experience based on user behavior)

### UK PropTech Insights

- The UK PropTech Innovation Fund specifically studied **barriers to adoption of digital engagement tools**
- Key finding: Government and partners play a role in reducing adoption barriers — suggesting that CRECI and COFECI in Brazil could play a similar facilitating role
- In the UK, adoption is "stalling" despite available technology — confirming that technology availability alone doesn't drive adoption

### Lessons for Brazil

| International Lesson | Brazil Application |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Data standardization reduces friction | Push for industry data format standards through COFECI |
| Mobile-first markets adopt differently | Build for WhatsApp-first, not desktop-first |
| Integration marketplaces work | Create open APIs and integration directories |
| Government can facilitate adoption | Partner with CRECI for technology certification |
| Community drives adoption | Invest in user communities, not just marketing |
| AI needs trust before utility | Shadow mode, gradual rollout, transparent metrics |

## 16. Conclusion

### The Core Problem

The onboarding of Brazilian real estate employees to third-party management software is not a single problem but an interconnected system of challenges spanning:

1. **Workforce readiness** — A diverse, largely self-employed workforce with variable digital literacy and no standardized technology training
2. **Cultural resistance** — A relationship-driven industry where formalized processes feel antithetical to how business is done
3. **Product-market fit** — Software designed for ideal workflows that don't match real-world agency operations
4. **Implementation complexity** — Data migration, integration, compliance, and change management all converging during onboarding
5. **Sustainability** — Initial adoption is hard; sustained usage is even harder when support, training, and incentives don't persist

### The Core Opportunity

The market conditions are exceptionally favorable for whoever solves this problem:

- **580,000–730,000 agents** and **70,000+ agencies** represent a massive addressable market
- **1,232+ PropTech startups** are competing for this market, but few have cracked onboarding
- **AI is the transformative technology** that can dramatically reduce onboarding friction (by working through familiar channels like WhatsApp)
- The **60% higher conversion** experienced by agencies using AI pre-service is a compelling business case
- Brazil is the **2nd largest real estate market** by number of agents globally

### The Winning Formula

Based on this research, the organizations that will succeed in solving the onboarding problem will:

1. **Meet agents where they are** — WhatsApp-first, mobile-first, simplicity-first
2. **Deliver value before demanding change** — Quick wins, shadow modes, benefit-first demonstrations
3. **Build trust progressively** — Role-based onboarding, progressive feature disclosure, peer validation
4. **Invest in ongoing support** — Not just initial training but continuous learning and community building
5. **Align incentives** — Make software adoption a competitive advantage, not an administrative burden
6. **Design for the 36%** — The resistant agents represent the largest untapped opportunity; solutions that work for them will work for everyone

### Final Observation

The Brazilian real estate PropTech market is at an inflection point. The technology exists. The funding is flowing. The market demand is clear. But the bridge between software availability and software adoption — the onboarding experience — remains the critical bottleneck. Whoever builds that bridge will capture an outsized share of a rapidly growing market.
